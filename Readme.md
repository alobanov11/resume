## Work experience

### Senior iOS Developer | Tabby (Fintech, BNPL)
*March 2023 – present (1 year 9 months) | Dubai, UAE*

- Led more than 20 features, including major initiatives:
	- Filter redesign (3 developers, 1 designer): reduced product search time by 30%, leading to a 4.2% increase in purchase conversion
	- Implementation of cashback for special offers (4 teams, 6 months): increased GMV by 25% in the first month
- Implemented a mechanism for tracking ad visibility, resulting in a 15% increase in CPM
- Regularly took on backend tasks in Go (creating a microservice, fixes, performance tuning) to unblock the team and speed up delivery of features for ad services

### iOS Tech Lead | MDK (Social Network)
*March 2020 – January 2023 (2 years 10 months) | Moscow, Russia*

- Organized the development process: 2-week sprints, code reviews (100% coverage), grooming, design hand off
- Optimized the main application feed: FPS from 35–45 → 55–60, time in feed +10–15%, support requests about lags −70–80%
- Incrementally modernized the architecture without stopping the development of new features: from a massive ViewController (3000+ lines) to a modular architecture
- Increased stability: crash-free rate increased from 95% to 99.5% through improving architecture
- Set up CI/CD: automatic builds reduced release time from 2 days to 2 hours

**Reason for leaving:** The company focused on the web3 direction, iOS development became less of a priority

### iOS Developer | Vyyer Technologies (Part-time contract)
*Nov 2021 – Apr 2022 (6 months, 20 hours/week) | San Francisco, US*

**Context:** Short-term contract to create an MVP, in parallel with the main job (agreed with the employer)

- Managed a team (iOS/Android/Backend); requirements, documentation, decomposition, planning; client communication in English

### iOS Developer | CFT Group | KoronaPay (Financial software)
*Sept 2019 – Mar 2020 (7 months) | Saint Petersburg*

- Implemented a new authorization flow together with the UX team: reduced churn at the registration stage by 20%
- Participated in updating the codebase from Objective‑C to Swift by covering the code with unit/UI tests (TDD); the share of Objective‑C dropped from 60% to 30.5%
- Initiated 10+ mob‑programming sessions for complex tasks and topics, improving knowledge sharing

**Reason for leaving:** Received an offer for a position with greater responsibility and the ability to influence the product

### iOS Developer | E-ngineers (Mobile Development)
*February 2018 – September 2019 (1 year 7 months) | Saint Petersburg*

- Designed a video‑calling module; integrated WebRTC from scratch
- Integrated MapKit and AVFoundation into a travel app (~1k DAU)

**Reason for leaving:** The company abandoned iOS product development
