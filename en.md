## Work experience

### Senior iOS Developer | Tabby (Fintech, BNPL)
*March 2023 – Present (1 year 9 months) | Dubai, UAE*

**Context:** Joined a fast-growing fintech startup to work in an international team and relocate from Russia

**Teamwork and achievements:**
- Work in a cross-functional team of 12 people (iOS, Android, Backend, QA, PM, Designer) on monetization through advertising
- Together with the team, increased advertising revenue by 25% in Q2 2024 by improving targeting and UX of ad units
- Led several projects: 1) filter redesign (3 developers, 1 designer): reduced product search time by 30%, which led to a 4.2% increase in conversion to purchase. 2) cashback (4 teams, 6 months): AB testing is currently underway.
- Mentored 2 junior iOS developers: both successfully passed the performance review
- Initiated weekly knowledge sharing sessions for the iOS + Design team (8 people), increasing the bus factor from 1 to 3 for critical components

**Technical improvements with business impact:**
- Optimized the main screen loading: the time to interactivity decreased from 1.2s to 0.8s, which increased D1 retention by 3%
- Implemented ad visibility analytics: more accurate tracking led to a 15% increase in CPM from advertisers
- Standardized work with the API together with the backend team: reduced the development time for new features by 20%

### iOS Tech Lead | MDK (Social Network)
*March 2020 – January 2023 (2 years 10 months) | Moscow, Russia*

**Context:** Grew from Middle to Tech Lead through consistent delivery of results and building trust with the team

**Product and Team Development:**
- Led the iOS department (3 developers) in a product with 30K DAU, working closely with the product and design
- Together with the team, increased user engagement by 40% through the implementation of a personalized feed and push notifications
- Organized the development process: 2-week sprints, code review (100% coverage), pair programming for complex tasks
- Developed a junior developer to a middle level in 1.5 years through mentoring and a gradual increase in responsibility

**Technical Achievements:**
- Step-by-step modernized the architecture without stopping the development of new features: from a massive ViewController (3000+ lines) to a modular architecture
- Increased stability: crash-free rate increased from 95% to 99.5% through systematic crash fixing and defensive programming
- Set up CI/CD in conjunction with DevOps: automatic builds reduced release time from 2 days to 2 hours

**Reason for leaving:** The company focused on the web3 direction, iOS development was no longer a priority

### iOS Developer | Vyyer Technologies (Part-time contract)
*November 2021 – April 2022 (6 months, 20 hours/week) | Remote*

**Context:** Short-term contract to create an MVP, in parallel with the main job (agreed with the employer)

- Worked in an Agile team on KoronaPay (money transfers) with a focus on reliability and security
- Implemented a new authorization flow together with the UX team: reduced churn at the registration stage by 20%
- Participated in a code review, studied best practices of enterprise development

**Reason for leaving:** Received an offer for a position with greater responsibility and the ability to influence the product

### iOS Developer | E-ngineers (Mobile development)
*February 2018 – September 2019 (1 year 7 months) | Saint Petersburg*

**My transition to iOS development**

- The only iOS developer in a team of 8 people, learned independence and responsibility
- Delivered 2 applications to the App Store from idea to release, working directly with clients
- Mastered iOS development through practice and self-study, moving from web development

### Frontend Developer | Previous experience
*2013 – 2018 (5 years)*

Web development gave me an understanding of the full development cycle, working with users and the importance of UX

## Key skills
